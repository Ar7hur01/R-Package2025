Our package 'InFieldR' is designed to streamline in-field sampling and satellite-based prediction for agricultural and environmental studies. The package provides a structured workflow for selecting sampling locations, collecting field measurements, and building predictive models to map spatial variability across a given area of interest (AOI).

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(InFieldR)
?inFieldR
```

```{r setup}
library(InFieldR)
```

```{r}
#masked_and_stacked_raster <- raster_stack_mask(raster_scene_folder, aoi, output_folder)
#print(masked_and_stacked_raster)
```
