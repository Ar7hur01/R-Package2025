# InFieldR

## Overview

**InFieldR** is an R package designed to streamline in-field sampling and satellite-based prediction for agricultural and environmental studies. The package provides a structured workflow for selecting optimal sampling number and locations, collecting field measurements, and building predictive models to map spatial variability across a given area of interest (AOI).

## Functionality

### 1. Sampling Location Selection
- The package utilizes covariate data (e.g., NDVI, soil properties, topography) to determine optimal in-field sampling locations and the number of samples required.

### 2. Field Data Collection
- Users collect measurements at the suggested locations in the field (e.g., chlorophyll content, biomass, soil properties).

### 3. Random Forest Regression Modeling
- A Random Forest regression model is built using the collected in-field measurements and corresponding satellite imagery.
- This model establishes the relationship between ground measurements and satellite-derived covariates.

### 4. Prediction & Mapping
- Once trained, the model is applied to new satellite imagery to generate a predicted map of the entire AOI.
- The resulting map provides spatial insights into the measured variable across the field.

## Use Case

This package is particularly useful for precision agriculture, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing applications where accurate spatial predictions are needed to support decision-making.
